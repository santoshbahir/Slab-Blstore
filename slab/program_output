If you have not got any Panics till now, Allocation works fine for c1
If you have not got any Panics till now, Destruction works fine for c1

Running Stress Test...
Now testing kmem_reap()
Now freeing All Caches
If you have not got a seg-fault or Panic till now, the allocator is probably OK
End of ALL tests
