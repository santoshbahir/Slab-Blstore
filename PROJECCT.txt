Slab Allocator:
A fast, and space-efficient kernel memory allocator simulation in user space. The object-cache
interface reduces the cost for allocating and freeing complex objects and decreaes reduce internal and
external fragmentation.


Transaction Block Store:
A transactional block store using the write­anywhere file layout (WAFL) scheme to ensure all operations including 
updates to data and meta­data must are atomic.

Slab Block Store:
This projects combines the ideas of slab allcator and Transactional block store. It investigates if block store
also can gain in efficiency and reduces fragmentation if slab allcocation mechanism is deployed for block store.
